description: Use this skill when the user asks to "stake hasui", "withdraw hasui", "instant withdraw hasui", or "claim hasui rewards". The haSUI module calls /api/v1/hasui/* via curl POST, sending only address, amount (and validator). On HTTP 200 it returns txBytes; on non‑200 it returns msg.

# Haedal haSUI

Call the haSUI HTTP APIs directly with curl, without any custom scripts.

**All numeric parameters are human‑readable amounts**: pass `amount` and other quantity fields as human‑readable values, without multiplying by decimals. For example, to stake 20 tokens, simply send `"amount":"20"`.

## Validator when staking

Only the **stake** method requires a `validator` (validator node `node_id`):

- Passing **`0x0`** means "use the default validator".
- If the user **does not provide a validator**: show a reference list of validators and let the user choose. The user can respond with **index 1–5** or the **validator name**. Map this to the corresponding `node_id` in the table and include it in the request.
- The reference list is defined in [`references/validators.md`](references/validators.md) (mapping between name and node_id, indexed 1–5).

Typical flow: the user says "stake hasui" without specifying a validator → present 5 reference validators (index + name) → the user replies with "1" or "Ankr", etc. → use the corresponding `node_id` to call stake.

## Claiming rewards and NFTObj

The **claim** endpoint requires **address** and **NFTObj** (the NFT object ID that holds the rewards). When the user says "claim hasui rewards":

1. **Ask the user** whether they want help finding the object id (if the user already knows the NFTObj, you can send it directly).
2. **If discovery is needed**: call **get_unstake_tickets_list** with the user `address`. On HTTP 200 the response body is `{"list":[{"objectId":"...","type":"...","version":"..."}, ...]}`. Use the `objectId` from `list` as **NFTObj**.
3. **If there are multiple entries in the list**: let the user choose which one to claim (or follow a predefined rule such as "take the first entry") and use that entry's `objectId` as NFTObj.
4. **Then call claim**: `POST /api/v1/hasui/claim` with body `{"address":"0x...","NFTObj":"<objectId from previous step>"}`.

Flow summary: the user says "claim hasui rewards" → ask whether to discover the object id → if yes, call get_unstake_tickets_list(address) → present the list (or let the user select one entry) → take the chosen `objectId` as NFTObj → call claim(address, NFTObj).

## curl examples

**stake**

Pass `validator` as `0x0` to use the default validator, or use a node_id from [`references/validators.md`](references/validators.md) (user can choose by index 1–5 or by name).

```bash
# Use the default validator
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/stake" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS","amount":"100","validator":"0x0"}'

# Or specify an explicit validator node_id (for example Haedal Protocol)
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/stake" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS","amount":"100","validator":"0xc8a57a7ae3b814afc15a907d963a288454b2c0f1a323fd556cb2d56d85a94583"}'
```

**withdraw**

```bash
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/withdraw" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS","amount":"100"}'
```

**withdraw_instant**

```bash
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/withdraw_instant" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS","amount":"100"}'
```

**get_unstake_tickets_list** (query the UnstakeTicket list that can be claimed, used to obtain NFTObj)

```bash
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/get_unstake_tickets_list" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS"}'
```

When the response status is 200, the body looks like: `{"list":[{"objectId":"0x...","type":"...","version":"..."}, ...]}`. Use `list[].objectId` as the **NFTObj** for the claim call.

**claim** (requires NFTObj, which can be obtained from get_unstake_tickets_list → list[].objectId)

```bash
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://skillsapi.haedal.xyz/api/v1/hasui/claim" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0xYOUR_ADDRESS","NFTObj":"0xOBJECT_ID_FROM_LIST"}'
```

## Response

- **stake / withdraw / withdraw_instant / claim**: on HTTP 200, the body is `{"txBytes":"<base64>"}`; use `jq -r '.txBytes'` to extract it. On non‑200, use `jq -r '.msg'` to return the error reason to the user.
- **get_unstake_tickets_list**: on HTTP 200, the body is `{"list":[{"objectId","type","version"}, ...]}`; use `jq -r '.list'` to obtain the list, then take each entry's `objectId` as the NFTObj for claim.
